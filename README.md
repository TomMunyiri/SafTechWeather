# SafTechWeather :partly_sunny:

An Android weather application implemented using the MVI pattern and clean architecture, Retrofit2, Dagger Hilt, Kotlin Flows, ViewModel, Coroutines, Room, Jetpack Compose, Kotlin DSL and some other libraries from the [Android Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack) . SafTech Weather fetches data from the [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/api-explorer.aspx) to provide real time weather information. 

## Architecture
The architecture of this application relies and complies with the following points below:
* Pattern [Model-View-Intent](https://krishanmadushankadev.medium.com/android-mvi-model-view-intent-architecture-example-code-bc7dc8edb33)(MVI) with Clean Architecture which facilitates separation of different layers of the application.
* [Android architecture components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/) which help to keep the application robust, testable, and maintainable.

## Technologies used:

* [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose) - A modern toolkit for building native Android UI
* [Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/kotlin_dsl.html) - An alternative syntax for writing Gradle build scripts using Kotlin.
* [Version Catalogs](https://developer.android.com/build/migrate-to-catalogs) - A scalable way of maintaining dependencies and plugins in a multi-module project.
* [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) a REST Client for Android which makes it relatively easy to retrieve and upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice.
* [Dagger Hilt](https://dagger.dev/hilt/) for dependency injection.
* [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel) to store and manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
* [StateFlow](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow/stateflow-and-sharedflow#:~:text=StateFlow%20is%20a%20state%2Dholder,property%20of%20the%20MutableStateFlow%20class) to enable flows to emit updated state and emit values to multiple consumers optimally.
* [Kotlin Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines/flow.html) to emit a stream of data with multiple values sequentially.
* [Timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) - a logger with a small, extensible API which provides utility on top of Android's normal Log class.
* [Material Design](https://material.io/develop/android/docs/getting-started/) an adaptable system of guidelines, components, and tools that support the best practices of user interface design.
* [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) used to manage the local storage i.e. `writing to and reading from the database`. Coroutines help in managing background threads and reduces the need for callbacks.
* [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room) persistence library which provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.
* [Paging Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging) helps you load and display small chunks of data at a time.
* [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx) which helps to write more concise, idiomatic Kotlin code.

## Features
- [ ] :TO BE UPDATED

## Installation
SafTech Weather requires a minimum API level of 24. Clone the repository. You will need an API key i.e. `API_KEY` from [Weather API](https://www.weatherapi.com/api-explorer.aspx) to request data. If you donâ€™t already have an account, you will need to create one in order to request an API Key.

In your project's root directory, inside the `local.properties` file (create one if unavailable) include the following lines:

````properties
BASE_URL = "http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/"
API_KEY = "YOUR_API_KEY"

````
